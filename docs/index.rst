Welcome to the Tradehub Python project.  The goal of this project is to empower other developers and end users by offering a Python client that is able to interact with all aspects of the Tradehub Blockchain and DEMEX Decentralized Exchange via its REST endpoints.
When using this package the developer does not have to worry about cryptographic signatures or interacting with the blockchain, that is handled within the client.
Allowing developers and end user to focus on **Trading**!
